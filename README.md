# AIMS-Project
TThis repository contains my AIMS project thesis analysis jupyter notebook files with codes that I used. This was my master's thesis that I did as part of the requirements to pursue a masters degree. It's about the investigating the changes in precipitation patterns and extremes during the 2023 El Nino event in West Africa and their impacts on the farming season.
